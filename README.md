# homebridge-huesensors

Enable or disable all Hue Motion Sensors using Siri.  This is useful when you don't want your lights to turn off/on automatically.

Credit goes to huejay for their API wrapper.

This version supports multiple bridges. You will need a username for each bridge and the bridge IP.

You also need to specify which sensors you want to enable and disable. Specify them in the "Filter" array of your config file.

For configuration information see sample-config file.
