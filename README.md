# homebridge-huesensors

Enable or disable all Hue Motion Sensors using Siri.  This is useful when you don't want your lights to turn off/on automatically.

Credit goes to huejay for their API wrapper.

This version supports multiple bridges. You will need a username for each bridge and the bridge IP.
